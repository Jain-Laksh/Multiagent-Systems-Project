\section{Author Contributions}
The work presented in this paper was divided among the authors as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Laksh Jain:} Responsible for the \textbf{Value-Based} Reinforcement Learning implementations. This included the development of the DQN, Double DQN, and SARSA agents, as well as the tuning of the experience replay buffer and target network mechanisms on the CartPole environment.
    \item \textbf{Surriya Gokul:} Responsible for the \textbf{Policy-Based} Reinforcement Learning implementations. This involved developing the REINFORCE and Actor-Critic agents, investigating the impact of baselines on variance reduction, and tuning the differing network architectures required for policy gradients.
    \item \textbf{Devansh Lodha:} Responsible for compilation of this report. This involved structuring the comparative analysis and authoring the technical documentation in \LaTeX.
\end{itemize}
